Go is a cross-platform, open source programming language
Go can be used to create high-performance applications
Go is a fast, statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and efficiency


What is Go Used For?

    Web development (server-side)
    Developing network-based programs
    Developing cross-platform enterprise applications
    Cloud-native development
    requires fewer resourse to run ie cpu and ram


Why Use Go?

    Go is fun and easy to learn
    Go has fast run time .and compilation time
        >>>Run time refers to how quickly a Go program executes when it’s running. 
        >>>Go is a compiled language, meaning it’s translated directly into machine code (binary) that the computer’s processor can execute efficiently.
        >>> This results in fast program execution compared to interpreted languages like Python or JavaScript, which rely on interpreters or virtual machines.
    Go has  compilation time.
        >>>Compilation time refers to how long it takes for the Go compiler (gc) to convert your source code into an executable binary. 
        >>>Go’s compiler is designed to be extremely fast, often compiling large projects in milliseconds or seconds.
    Go supports concurrency
        >>>Concurrency is the ability of a program to handle multiple tasks at the same time ie in parralel, such as processing multiple user requests or performing parallel computations.
    Go has memory management
        >>>Go has automatic garbage collection (GC), meaning the runtime automatically reclaims memory that’s no longer in use, freeing developers from manual memory management (like in C/C++ with malloc/free).
    Go works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
    Multi threading refers to   where multiple threads runnning multiple threads simultanously 
    with go we use go routine for concurency 


    that is why go was created ie to prevemt concurency issues 
     it was created to run on multiple cores and built to support  concurency

mainly used for apps that need to be verry performant and aslo apps that will be run on the cloud service ie on multiple servers 
more technologies that are run on the cloud are written in go
