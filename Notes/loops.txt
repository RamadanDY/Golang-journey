Each execution of a loop is called an iteration.


✅ 1. this is the traditional way of writing arrays 

The for loop can take up to three statements:
for statement1; statement2; statement3 {
   // code to be executed for each iteration
}
statement1 Initializes the loop counter value.

statement2 Evaluated for each loop iteration. If it evaluates to TRUE, the loop continues. If it evaluates to FALSE, the loop ends.

statement3 Increases the loop counter value.



this is the second type of array that we can use 
ie ✅ 1. Using for ... range (most common)


Syntax
arrayName :=[] int{1,2,3,4,5,6} 
for index, value := range arrayName {
    // use index and value here
}
